My map consists of three classes: ENSE 271, ENSE 350, ENSE 480. It actually contains my workout and part time work schedule. This describes the story of 
my life throughout the semester. The whole schedule is broken down into 3 releases. Each release is about biweekly schedule. I have included five detailed tasks
in the map. Three of them are classes and two of them are my workout and part-time work schedule.

The extra features that I have tried are Annotations like Depends on other, idea, needs discussion and splittable, status, and additional card colors. 
Further, markdown features that I tried are strikethrough and different heading 
features. Every tasks has their estimated time which is calculated in hours.
